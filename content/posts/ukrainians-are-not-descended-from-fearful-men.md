In 1676 Ukrainians received a letter from the head of Ottoman Empire Mr Mehmed IV asking them "to submit to me voluntarily and without any resistance, and to desist from troubling me with your attacks". Ukrainians put their best suits on and proceeded to respond as pictured below

Mehmed the IV, know as "holy warrior" and "the hunter" presided over Ottoman empire at the top of its territorial expansion. Earlier in 1676 Ukrainians had defeated his troops at the battlefield.

In his letter, Mehmed insisted that Ukrainians had to submit because he was "grandson and viceroy of God", "extraordinary knight", "never defeated" and "trustee chosen by God Himself". Ukrainian cossacks obviously did not have any cards to play in this situation, one might say.

Or did they? Ukrainians opened by saying that Mehmed "canst not slay a hedgehog with your naked arse", called him "son of a whore" and followed by pointing out that "we have no fear of your army, by land and by sea we will battle with thee".

Mehmed was asked to "fuck his mother" and called a "fool of all the world and underworld". Here's the full translated version of the letter (source: [www.labrujulaverde.com/en/2019/05/t...](https://www.labrujulaverde.com/en/2019/05/the-irreverent-letter-the-cossacks-wrote-to-the-ottoman-sultan-in-1676/))

My point is, if you dig deeper in Ukrainian history, you will find that Ukrainians "are not descended from fearful men" and while some of our American friends lost their marbles while others left their testicles at home, Ukraine made it clear to everybody that it will fight and will prevail

I am off my soap box for today. Pardon my clumsy metaphors and amateur hour history stuff. Get your Ukrainian history and good metaphors from [@timothysnyder.bsky.social](https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:xl3w4e5jxslqeaglaqit2ql3) and support Ukraine, pretty please
