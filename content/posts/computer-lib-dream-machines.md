## The Pledge

- The purpose of computers is human freedom.
- I am going to help make people free through computers.
- I will not help the computer priesthood confuse and bully the public.
- I will endeavor to explain patiently what computer systems really do.
- I will not give misleading answers to get people off my back, like “Because that’s the way computers work” instead of “Because that’s the way I designed it.”
- I will stand firm against the forces of evil.
- I will speak up against computer systems that are oppressive, insulting, or unkind, and do the best I can to improve or replace them, if I cannot prevent them from being bought or created in the first place.
- I will fight injustice, complication, and any company that makes things difficult on purpose.
- I will do all I can to further human understanding, especially through the new visualizing tools of interactive computer graphics.
- I will do what I can to make systems easy to understand, interactive wherever possible, and fun for the user.
- I will try not to make fun of another user’s favorite computer language, even if it is COBOL or BASIC.
